                    <p>Another American election is upon us, and political passions are running high. There is a lot at
                        stake in 2020. How should a Christian view this election? What guidance does Reformed
                        Presbyterian doctrine offer as we consider our vote? Such questions are on the minds of many in
                        our congregations (particularly RP congregations in the United States). These questions also
                        received significant attention—and no small debate—at synod this past summer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the June 2019 meeting of synod, a committee of six ministers presented a paper on voting for
                        synod’s consideration. Their paper was called, “Christ-Centered Voting: A Practical Guide for
                        Bible-Believing Christians” (<i>2019 Minutes of Synod</i>, pp. 111–32). The authors’ stated goal
                        was to
                        exposit the <i>RP Testimony</i>’s guidance on voting, and to offer that guidance to
                        the wider church in
                        anticipation of the 2020 elections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While synod approved publication of the paper as “one” important perspective on voting (it is
                        forthcoming from Crown and Covenant), synod also made clear that the paper does not represent
                        “the” position of the <i>RP Testimony</i> on the topic. The <i>Testimony</i> defines the doctrinal
                        boundaries
                        within which various perspectives on voting might be held. The position espoused in the
                        “Christ-Centered Voting” paper is one of those perspectives, but other positions are also
                        permissible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The authors of this present article are among those who disagreed with the position promoted by
                        that paper at synod. While we affirm that paper’s position as “one” perspective that fits within
                        the <i>Testimony</i>’s framework, and while we are grateful its forthcoming publication will stimulate
                        a timely conversation about voting in the church, we also believe more needs to be said about
                        the scope of the views affirmed within the <i>RP Testimony</i> than represented by that paper. We
                        therefore hope that this article will be an edifying corollary to that forthcoming booklet in
                        the service of denomination-wide deliberations about voting in 2020.
                    </p>

                    <h2>
                        Our Heritage and Testimony
                    </h2>
                    Ever since the first Blue Banner was sewn together on the moors of Scotland, Covenanters have borne
                    witness “For Christ’s Crown and Covenant.” To preserve that witness, a written <i>Testimony</i> was
                    prepared. The earliest versions of that <i>Testimony</i> captured studied conclusions on various doctrines,
                    including civil government.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As some Reformed Presbyterians left Britain for the New World, they refined the <i>Testimony</i> to
                        better apply its doctrines in a North American context. The most recent clarifications on the
                        doctrine of civil government were adopted as recently as 1963, including several paragraphs
                        pertinent to the question of voting. We will consider a few of those passages in this article,
                        beginning with the foundational convictions captured in the chapter’s second paragraph.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “God has given the exercise of all authority to the Lord Jesus Christ. Christ is the Divine
                        Lawgiver, Governor and Judge. His will concerning the purpose of civil government and the
                        principles regarding its functions and operation are revealed in the written Word of God. The
                        Holy Spirit enables even unregenerate rulers to fulfill their proper functions. A true
                        recognition of the authority and law of Christ in national life can only be the fruit of the
                        Spirit’s regenerating power in the lives of individuals” (<i>RPT</i> 23.2).
                    </p>

                    <h2>
                        Already King of America
                    </h2>
                    Perhaps the most compelling feature of the passage just quoted, is our joyful declaration that Jesus
                    is already the king over all things—including the state. It is not our place to “make” Jesus king.
                    Someone with absolute authority has already elected him as “King of kings and Lord of lords” (Rev.
                    17:14; 19:16). “God has highly exalted him..., so that at the name of Jesus every knee should
                    bow...” (Php. 2:7-11). We yearn for revival, such that both individuals and governments would come
                    to honor Christ’s crown. But Jesus is already king, regardless.
                    </p>
                    Because Jesus already rules as the sovereign over every nation, our <i>Testimony</i> asserts, “The Holy
                    Spirit enables even unregenerate rulers to fulfill their proper functions.” We pray for God to raise
                    up Christian rulers who will conscientiously serve Christ. But King Jesus knows how to advance his
                    purposes, even through unconverted rulers. This means that we should expect all rulers—believing and
                    unbelieving alike—to uphold Jesus’ principles of justice and righteousness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Paul explains, “There is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted
                        by God... He is God’s servant for your good” (Rom. 13:1–5). Paul’s words are not a blanket
                        endorsement of all that rulers do. He rather leads us to expect Christ’s justice even at the
                        hands of unregenerate governors—and, as far as it is in our power to do so, we should hold them
                        accountable to uphold heaven’s righteousness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    This doctrine lays the groundwork for the <i>Testimony</i>’s guidance on voting. We will not always
                        have a candidate on the ticket with a clear witness of love for Christ, but we do have a duty to
                        expect even unregenerate candidates to be measured against Jesus’ principles of righteousness.
                    </p>

                    <h2>
                        Whether to Vote, At All
                    </h2>
                    Sometimes, we may find that no candidate warrants our vote. In past generations, the RPCNA resisted
                    participation in the political process altogether. Because the U. S. Constitution neglects to
                    acknowledge King Jesus, a previous version of our <i>Testimony</i> instructed church members to abstain
                    from voting altogether.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Prior to the revisions made in the early 1960s, the previous version of our <i>Testimony</i> exhorted,
                        “The only position consistent for the Christian is the position of dissent from any constitution
                        or form of civil government which refuses or neglects to own allegiance to Jesus Christ, the
                        Prince of the kings of the earth... [They] are also under moral obligation to relinquish all
                        such privileges of citizenship [e.g., voting] as may tend to neutralize their testimony to the
                        regal rights and claims of Christ.” (<i>RPT 1950</i> 30.1, 3)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, we still decry America’s neglect of King Jesus (Psa. 2:10–12). But we no longer regard it
                        as necessary to dissent from political involvement in the meantime. It was about sixty years ago
                        that the RPCNA undertook these changes. The previous practice of wholesale dissent had been
                        shaped by the church’s experiences under the British monarchy in the Old World. It took several
                        generations in the New World to reflect on the application of denominational convictions in the
                        American political context, and to refine our <i>Testimony</i> accordingly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Synod began its review of the former position in the early 1960s, and that study became a
                        church-wide conversation through a series of articles in the denominational magazine (then
                        called, <i>Covenanter Witness</i>). The result of those deliberations are the changes reflected in
                        chapter 23 of the current <i>RP Testimony</i>. Given the range of views in the church then (like now),
                        the new language of the <i>Testimony</i> was necessarily the language of consensus. It was designed to
                        allow room for a variety of applications, including views still inclined toward dissent as well
                        as views accommodating more active electoral participation—all in adherence to the same
                        theological commitments.
                    </p>

                    <h2>
                        Guidance for Voting
                    </h2>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The <i>Testimony</i> now recognizes that a Christian can serve the reign of Jesus by political
                        involvement, even if a nation has not (yet) acknowledged Christ’s crown. And in chapter 23,
                        paragraph 15 (cf., para. 19), this guidance on voting is given: “The Christian, when such action
                        involves no disloyalty to Christ, ought to be involved in the selection of and to vote for civil
                        rulers who fear God, love truth and justice, hate evil, and are publicly committed to scriptural
                        principles of civil government.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This paragraph urges us to cast our vote for candidates marked by three motivations: fear of
                        God, love for truth and justice, and hatred of evil; and whose public positions reflect
                        “scriptural principles of civil government.” Today’s debates about the <i>Testimony</i>’s guidance on
                        voting essentially ask how broadly or restrictively those terms are to be applied. Let’s first
                        consider the threefold set of motivations we are urged to consider. Then, we will reflect on the
                        standard for assessing a candidate’s positions.
                    </p>

                    <h2>
                        The Three-fold Motivation Assessment
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                    The <i>Testimony</i> urges us to discern, as best we can, three motivations in a candidate before we
                    vote for him or her. Does the candidate demonstrate the <i>fear</i> of God, a <i>love</i> for truth and
                    justice, and <i>hatred</i> of evil? Many candidates are motivated by pride, by “hot button” issues, or
                        by money, or other interests. But we ought to watch for motivations that reflect Jesus’ purposes
                        for civil government.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some interpret that sequence of qualifications quite narrowly. They interpret “fear God ... love
                        truth ... and hate evil” to mean that a candidate must have a credible profession of
                        evangelical—even Reformed Presbyterian—faith in order to receive their vote. For example, the
                        previously mentioned “Christ-Centered Voting” paper argues, “The [vote-worthy] candidate must be
                        a credibly professing Christian ... who openly avows the supreme authority of King Jesus” (<i>2019
                            Minutes of Synod</i>, pp. 113–14).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    We, the authors of this article, agree with our brothers that the <i>Testimony</i> points us to such a
                        high standard as the ideal for which we watch and pray. However, we also believe that the
                        <i>Testimony</i> uses the descriptors “fear of God ... love for justice ... and hatred of evil” as
                        guidance to evaluate less-than-ideal options, as well. The <i>Testimony</i> does call us to seek
                        candidates who explicitly promote the crown of Jesus; but it does not require church members to
                        abstain from voting until such candidates appear.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To “fear God” does not necessarily mean a candidate is regenerate. The term “fear of God” is
                        frequently used to capture a broader scope of reverence beyond explicit Christian faith. For
                        instance, in Acts 13:16, 26, the term is used for those who attended the Jewish synagogue out of
                        genuine reverence, but who were neither proselytes to the synagogue nor yet believers in Jesus.
                        The <i>Testimony</i> could use a more precise phrase like “love Christ,” rather than “fear God,” if the
                        church held that one should vote only for regenerate candidates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The term “fear God,” taken in its fullest extent, encompasses all those who believe God exists
                        and who believe that he judges human affairs. Understood in this manner, the <i>Testimony</i> urges us
                        to abstain, at a minimum, from voting for atheists and deists. Those who believe morality is
                        subjective and changeable by social whim, and who lack reverence for transcendent, objective
                        truth rooted in our Creator, cannot be supported by those with a view to Jesus’ rule over the
                        state. Rather, we should vote for those who demonstrate a genuine sense of reverence for God’s
                        justice—whether or not they have a personal relationship with Jesus (yet).

                        Reviewing some of the debates leading up to the 1963 revision supports this understanding. In
                        fact, the debates that produced the <i>Testimony</i>’s changes took place in the wake of the 1960
                        presidential election. The angst of that contest between John F. Kennedy (a Roman Catholic) and
                        Richard Nixon (a Quaker) is evident at various points in those <i>Covenanter Witness</i> articles. One
                        minister even voiced his understanding that the proposed change would allow him to vote for the
                        Quaker candidate in that contest: “In the last election, it seemed to me most important that
                        Christians should make their influence felt [by voting] as we faced the prospects of Roman
                        Catholicism strengthening its hold upon our land” (<i>Covenanter Witness</i> 48.10, Mar. 7, 1962,
                        p152).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Neither a Roman Catholic nor a Quaker measure up to the ideal anticipated by the <i>Testimony</i>.
                        Nevertheless, it is left to the church member to discern whether such candidates might be
                        regarded as “fearing God” and, indeed, “loving truth and justice” and “hating evil” sufficiently
                        to receive a vote. It is impossible to know a candidate’s heart for certain, but by listing this
                        threefold series of motivations, the <i>Testimony</i> urges Christians to exercise their best
                        discernment and to vote with King Jesus’ reign in view: looking for candidates whose sense of
                        conscience before God and passion for objective justice make them useful as “God’s servant for
                        your good” (Rom. 13:5).

                    <h2>
                        Scriptural Principles of Government
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                    In addition to specific motivations to watch for, the <i>Testimony</i> also identifies the standard for
                        measuring a candidate’s positions. “The Christian... [ought] to vote for civil rulers who ...
                        are publicly committed to scriptural principles of civil government.” (<i>RPT</i> 23.15; cf., 23.19)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The phrase “scriptural principles of civil government” captures all that King Jesus assigns to
                        states as their duty before him. Paul writes, “Rulers are ... God’s servant[s] for your good...
                        [and] avenger[s] who carries out God’s wrath on the wrongdoer” (Rom. 13:3–4). The Scriptures
                        teach to love our neighbor, to care for the weak, to provide for the poor, to preserve a
                        neighbor’s property, to promote the integrity of the family and the honesty of business
                        dealings, to pursue only justice in war, and so forth. These are all matters of concern to King
                        Jesus as governor of the nations. The <i>Testimony</i> calls us to assess the policies of candidates in
                        relation to Jesus’ priorities for human society.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Modern campaign rhetoric tends to focus on the benefit a candidate’s victory would bring to the
                        voter’s own station in life, to one’s job prospects, to a certain business market, or to other
                        civic causes that will resonate with the voter’s personal concerns. But the Christian should
                        resist those temptations and vote, instead, to advance “scriptural principles of civil
                        government.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Again, there are some who interpret this line of the <i>Testimony</i> more narrowly. At synod this past
                        summer, the previously mentioned committee argued, “The [vote-worthy] candidate must publicly
                        state his intention to ‘kiss the Son’... The candidate must appeal openly to the authority of
                        Scripture... [And] the candidate must testify openly against anti-Christian principles” (<i>2019
                            Minutes of Synod</i>, pp. 120, 122).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Such requirements do capture the ideal for which we are to pray and labor. But it strains the
                        <i>Testimony</i> to interpret its guidance as requiring dissent from all voting until that ideal
                        emerges. The language of the present <i>Testimony</i> was chosen to affirm the viability of serving
                        King Jesus while voting for candidates who may fall short of his ideal, but whose positions
                        demonstrate meaningful coherence with his principles of justice.

                    <p>
                        After extensive debate over the “Christ-Centered Voting” paper this past June, synod declined
                        the committee’s request to “adopt” the paper since it does not provide a full statement of the
                        <i>Testimony</i>’s teaching on the matter. Synod also declined to “approve” the paper since it does not
                        reflect a consensus of synod’s thinking on the topic. The paper was instead “received,” which is
                        a category synod assigns to documents that offer one allowable perspective, but not the
                        perspective endorsed by synod as a whole.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This present article is offered as an alternate view to that paper, mindful that it is in
                        process for publication. By having both that forthcoming paper and this present article, we hope
                        that church members today—as in a past generation—will be able to participate in this corporate
                        debate over the important question of voting.

                    <p>
                    The <i>Testimony</i> gives room for these differences on how we exercise our political rights, but it
                        also unites us in this common conviction: “It is the duty of every Christian citizen to labor
                        and pray for his nation’s official and explicit recognition of the authority and law of Jesus
                        Christ, Preserver and Ruler of nations, and for the conduct of all governmental affairs in
                        harmony with the written Word of God” (<i>RPT</i> 23.6). However we exercise our votes, it is that
                        shared vision that should motivate all Reformed Presbyterians.

                <div class="p-3 mb-3 bg-light rounded">
                    <h4 class="font-italic">Concerning verbs</h4>
                    <p>
                        Both we (the authors of this article) and the writers of the “Christ-Centered Voting” guide
                        subscribe to the same doctrinal ideal. We all share the <i>Testimony</i>’s conviction that, “Every
                        nation ought to recognize the Divine institution of civil government ... [and] should enter into
                        covenant with Christ and serve to advance His Kingdom on earth” (<i>RPT</i> 23.4). But we disagree on
                        how closely a candidate must adhere to that ideal before we are permitted to vote for him or
                        her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reading presented in this article is further supported, we believe, by a syntactical nuance
                        of the verbs in the <i>Testimony</i>. One of the nuances of confessional documents like the RP
                        <i>Testimony</i> is the careful use of helping verbs, like “may,” “ought,” “must,” and “shall.” Helping
                        verbs like “must” and “shall” are used to indicate an absolute requirement. These are
                        <i>restrictive verbs</i>. Instructions given with restrictive verbs must be strictly followed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    On the other extreme, helping verbs like “may” or “might” are <i>permissive verbs</i>. Instructions
                        given with permissive verbs are regarded as prudent advice, but not nearly so forceful as those
                        with restrictive verbs. In between these two extremes is a category of urgent verbs, meaning,
                        verbs that “urge” or “push” in a particular direction. Helping verbs like “should” and “ought”
                        convey such urging, and they press us toward an ideal without restricting action to the stated
                        condition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The <i>Testimony</i>’s instructions on voting employ such urgent verbs. For instance, <i>RPT</i> 23.15 states,
                    “The Christian ... <b>ought</b> to be involved in the selection of and to vote for civil rulers who
                        fear God [and so forth].” This wording impresses us to employ our votes in a manner that moves
                        toward the ideal stated, but it does not restrict us to voting only when the stated conditions
                        fully exist.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A restrictive form of verbs would make it clear, if members were to abstain from voting until
                        the ideal is present. For instance, that same paragraph in the <i>Testimony</i> might have been
                        written: “The Christian ... <b>must only</b> be involved in the selection of and <b>must only</b> vote for
                        civil rulers who fear God [and so forth].” This wording would indicate that dissent from voting
                        is expected until the ideal standard for a candidate was met. But this is not the verb form
                        used, and the <i>Testimony</i> is not requiring dissent from voting for less-than-ideal candidates. It
                        is left to each individual’s own conscience to determine how to exercise his or her vote in
                        service of Christ’s crown and the advance of his justice in the land.
