                            This article was written in response to the booklet, “Christ-Centered Voting: A Practical
                            Guide for Bible-Believing
                            Christians” (Crown and Covenant, 2020).

                        <p>
                            The “Christ-Centered Voting” booklet is an effort to
                            explain the guidance of the
                            <i>Reformed Presbyterian Testimony</i> on the topic of voting.
                            It was presented to the Synod of the RPCNA at its June
                            2019 meeting. At that meeting, the RP Synod “received”
                            the booklet as a resource, but
                            Synod declined to “adopt” or
                            “approve” it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Those latter designations
                            (“adopt” or “approve”) are
                            given to documents that represent the denomination’s
                            official position on a matter.
                            Since the “Christ-Centered
                            Voting” booklet represents
                            only one application, and
                            does not represent the full
                            range of applications allowed
                            by the <i>Testimony’s</i> voting
                            guidance, Synod refrained
                            from “approving” or “adopting” it. However, Synod did
                            “receive” the booklet and directed that it be published
                            as one possible position, in
                            hopes that its publication
                            would foster further discussion of other views as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is in that spirit of discussion
                            encouraged by Synod that
                            we now offer this article. The
                            following was written as an alternative position to that outlined in the “Christ-Centered
                            Voting” booklet. This article is
                            our effort to provide a more
                            full interpretation of the RPCNA’s <i>Testimony</i> on voting and
                            to fill some of the gaps left by
                            the narrower application of
                            the “Christ-Centered Voting”
                            guide.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We hope that, together, the
                            “Christ-Centered Voting”
                            booklet and this article will
                            assist Reformed Presbyterians and other Christians as
                            they prayerfully consider how
                            to participate in political elections as faithful servants of
                            King Jesus.

                            Another American election is upon us, and on November third,
                            millions of Americans will go to the polls to vote. There is a lot at stake in this
                            year’s election. For Reformed Presbyterians in America, this is an opportune moment
                            to revisit the guidance on voting provided in our denominational <i>Testimony</i>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ever since the first Blue Banner was sewn together on the moors of Scotland, Covenanters
                            have borne witness “For Christ’s Crown and Covenant”&mdash;including our commitment to his
                            crown
                            rights over the state. These convictions
                            have been compiled into our written <i>Testimony</i>, first developed in 17th century
                            Scotland and revised through the centuries since. As some Reformed Presbyterians left
                            Britain for the New World, they refined the <i>Testimony</i> to better apply its
                            doctrines in a North American context.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The most recent clarifications on the doctrine of civil government added to the
                            <i>Testimony</i>
                            were
                            adopted as recently as 1963. These revisions include several paragraphs on voting. This
                            article
                            will focus on those passages that address voting, after first attending to the church’s
                            foundational convictions on civil government captured in the second paragraph of the
                            <i>Testimony’s</i> chapter on that topic (chap. 23).

                        <h2>
                            Already King of America
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            “God has given the exercise of all authority to the Lord Jesus Christ. Christ is
                            the Divine Lawgiver, Governor and Judge. His will concerning the purpose of
                            civil government and the principles regarding its functions and operation are
                            revealed in the written Word of God. The Holy Spirit enables even unregenerate
                            rulers to fulfill their proper functions. A true recognition of the authority and law
                            of Christ in national life can only be the fruit of the Spirit’s regenerating power in
                            the lives of individuals” <i>(RPT 23.2)</i>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Perhaps the most compelling feature of the RP doctrine on civil government, is our joyful
                            declaration
                            that Jesus is already king over all things, including the state. It is not our place to
                            “make” Jesus king.
                            Someone with absolute
                            authority has already elected him as King of
                            Kings and Lord of Lords. “God has highly exalted
                            him&hellip;, so that at the name of Jesus every knee
                            should bow&hellip;” (Php. 2:7-11). We yearn for revival, such that both individuals and
                            governments
                            would come to honor Christ’s crown. But Jesus
                            is already king, regardless.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because Jesus already rules over every
                            nation, our <i>Testimony</i> asserts, “The Holy Spirit
                            enables even unregenerate rulers to fulfill their
                            proper functions.” We pray for God to raise up
                            Christian rulers who will conscientiously serve Christ. But King Jesus
                            knows how to advance his purposes
                            even through unconverted rulers.
                            This means that we should expect
                            all rulers—believing and unbelieving
                            alike—to uphold Jesus’ principles of
                            justice and righteousness.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Paul explains, “There is no authority except from God, and those
                            that exist have been instituted by God&hellip; He is
                            God’s servant for your good” (Rom. 13:1–5).
                            Those words are not a blanket endorsement of
                            all that rulers do. Rather, the apostle urges us in
                            that passage, to expect Christ’s justice even at
                            the hands of unregenerate governors and, as
                            far as it is in our power to do so, to hold them
                            accountable to heaven’s righteousness.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This doctrine lays the groundwork for the
                            <i>Testimony’s</i> guidance on voting. We will not
                            always have a candidate on the ticket with a
                            clear witness of love for Christ, but we do have a
                            duty to expect even unregenerate candidates to
                            be measured against Jesus’ principles of righteousness.
                        </p>

                        <h2>
                            Whether to Vote, At All
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Sometimes, we may find that no candidate warrants our vote. In past generations, the RPCNA
                            resisted participation in the political process
                            altogether. Because the U. S. Constitution does
                            not acknowledge King Jesus, a previous version
                            of our <i>Testimony</i> instructed church members to
                            abstain from voting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An older version of our <i>Testimony</i> exhorted,
                            “The only position consistent for the Christian
                            is the position of dissent from any constitution
                            or form of civil government which refuses or
                            neglects to own allegiance to Jesus Christ, the
                            Prince of the kings of the earth&hellip; [They] are also
                            under moral obligation to relinquish all such
                            privileges of citizenship [e.g., voting] as may
                            tend to neutralize their testimony to the regal
                            rights and claims of Christ.” (<i>RPT</i> 1950, 30.1, 3)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That former stance of wholesale dissent had been
                            shaped by the church’s experiences under the British
                            monarchy. It took several generations in the New World
                            to reflect on the application of RP convictions in the
                            American political context, and to refine our <i>Testimony</i>
                            accordingly. Synod began its review of the former position in the early 1960s. The
                            deliberations in synod were
                            then opened up to the wider church through a series of
                            articles in the denominational magazine (then called,
                            <i>Covenanter Witness</i>). Those deliberations in the church
                            courts and among the membership accommodated a
                            wide range
                            of opinions, ranging from
                            those who
                            retained
                            a conviction of
                            wholesale
                            dissent
                            to those who believed political participation could be a
                            means to promote Christ’s rule in American politics.

                        <p>
                            The result of those deliberations are the changes
                            reflected in chapter 23 of the current <i>RP Testimony</i>. And
                            given the range of views in the church, the new language of the <i>Testimony</i> was
                            necessarily
                            the language of
                            consensus. It was designed to allow room for a variety
                            of applications—including views still inclined toward
                            dissent as well as views accommodating greater participation—all to be guided by commitment
                            to Jesus’
                            crown rights.

                            Guidance for Voting
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            For those Reformed Presbyterians who would participate in political elections, the
                            <i>Testimony</i>
                            provides guidance for doing so in light of Christ’s kingship. In chapter
                            23, paragraph 15 (cf., para. 19), this guidance is given:
                            “The Christian, when such action involves no disloyalty
                            to Christ, ought to be involved in the selection of and to
                            vote for civil rulers who fear God, love truth and justice,
                            hate evil, and are publicly committed to scriptural principles of civil government.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This paragraph urges us to cast our vote for candidates marked by three motivations: fear of
                            God, love for
                            truth and justice, and hatred of evil; and whose public
                            positions reflect “scriptural principles of civil government.” Let’s first examine the
                            threefold set of motivations we are urged to consider. Then, we will reflect on
                            the standard for assessing a candidate’s positions.
                        </p>

                        <h2>
                            The Three-fold Motivation Assessment
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            The <i>Testimony</i> urges us to discern, as best we can, three
                            motivations in a candidate before we vote for him or
                            her. Does the candidate demonstrate the fear of God,
                            a love for truth and justice, and a hatred of evil? Many
                            candidates are motivated by pride, by “hot button” issues, by money, or other interests. The
                            <i>Testimony</i> urges
                            us to watch for three good motivations, being motivations consistent with Jesus’ purposes
                            for civil government.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today, as in the 1960s, there are varying opinions in
                            the church regarding how narrowly or broadly to apply
                            those qualifications. For instance, are we to vote only
                            for candidates who demonstrate a “fear of God” through
                            a strong, evangelical faith? Or is it appropriate to vote
                            for a candidate who demonstrates a genuine sense of
                            accountability to God without (yet) professing faith in
                            Jesus? Consensus language—like the
                            term “fear God” rather than the more
                            explicit, “profess Jesus”—is designed
                            to allow room for such differing
                            opinions within the church regarding the application of our <i>Testimony</i>
                            while nonetheless keeping our varied
                            forms of political engagement united
                            around the same convictions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some in the church interpret that
                            sequence of qualifications more narrowly. They interpret “fear God &hellip; love
                            truth &hellip; and hate evil” to mean that
                            a candidate must have a credible profession of evangelical—even Reformed Presbyterian—faith
                            in order to
                            receive their vote. This is a legitimate application of the
                            <i>Testimony’s</i> guidance, but it is not the only application
                            permitted by these terms. This list of motivations guides
                            Reformed Presbyterians who would consider voting for
                            less-ideal candidates as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To “fear God” does not necessarily mean a candidate
                            is regenerate. The term “fear of God” is frequently used
                            to capture a broader scope of reverence beyond explicit
                            Christian faith. For instance, in Acts 13:16, 26, the term is
                            used for those who attended the Jewish synagogue out
                            of genuine reverence, but who were neither proselytes
                            to the synagogue nor yet believers in Jesus. The <i>Testimony</i> could use a more precise
                            phrase,
                            like “love Christ”
                            rather than “fear God,” if the church held that one should
                            vote only for regenerate candidates.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The term “fear God” can encompass all those who
                            believe God exists and who believe that he judges
                            human affairs. Understood in this manner, the <i>Testimony</i> urges us to abstain, at a
                            minimum,
                            from voting
                            for atheists and deists. Those who believe morality is
                            subjective, and that it is changeable by social whim, and
                            who lack reverence for transcendent, objective truth
                            rooted in our Creator, cannot be supported by those
                            with a view to Jesus’ rule over the state. Rather, we
                            should vote for those who demonstrate a genuine sense
                            of reverence for God’s justice—whether or not they have
                            a personal relationship with Jesus (yet). Likewise, the terms “love for truth and justice”
                            and
                            “hatred of evil” instruct us to look for candidates
                            with a demonstrated commitment to the principles of Jesus’ law, whether or not they know
                            Jesus personally.

                            Whether a voter selects candidates based
                            on a more narrow application (e.g., professing Christian candidates only) or a less narrow
                            application (e.g., unregenerate but God-fearing candidates, also) of these qualifications,
                            all Reformed Presbyterians are urged by these
                            qualifications to labor and pray for candidates
                            who demonstrate motivations consistent with Jesus’
                            purposes for civil government. All Reformed Presbyterians are urged to examine
                            the motivations of candidates with a view toward
                            their duty, in Paul’s words, to
                            serve as “God’s servant[s] for
                            your good” (Rom. 13:4)

                            Reviewing the debates
                            leading up to the 1963
                            revision demonstrates the
                            presence of this wide range
                            of perspectives at the time this guidance was
                            drafted. In fact, the debates that produced the
                            <i>Testimony’s</i> changes took place in the wake
                            of the 1960 presidential election. The angst of
                            that contest between John F. Kennedy (a Roman Catholic) and Richard Nixon (a Quaker) is
                            evident at various points in those <i>
                                Covenanter

                            </i> articles. One minister even voiced his
                            understanding that the proposed change would
                            allow him to vote for the Quaker candidate in
                            that contest: “In the last election, it seemed to
                            me most important that Christians should make
                            their influence felt [by voting] as we faced the
                            prospects of Roman Catholicism strengthening
                            its hold upon our land” (<i>Covenanter Witness</i>
                            48.10, Mar. 7, 1962, p152).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Neither a Roman Catholic nor a Quaker measures up to the ideal anticipated by the
                            <i>Testimony</i>. Some Reformed Presbyterians will
                            conclude that faithfulness to Christ’s crown requires abstention from voting altogether in
                            the
                            face of such options. But some Reformed Presbyterians will conclude that faithfulness to
                            King
                            Jesus allows (even encourages) them to vote
                            for a candidate who at least embodies motivations consistent with Jesus’ purposes for civil
                            government, even if neither candidate is ideal.
                            Both applications are to be respected, so long as
                            all are seeking to promote civil government that
                            fears God, loves truth and justice, and hates evil.

                        <p>
                            It is impossible to know a candidate’s heart.
                            But by listing this threefold series of motivations,
                            the <i>Testimony</i> urges Christians to exercise their
                            best discernment and to vote with King Jesus’
                            reign in view: looking for candidates whose
                            sense of conscience before God and passion
                            for objective justice make them useful as “God’s
                            servant[s] for your good.”

                        <p>
                            In addition to specific motivations to watch for,
                            the <i>Testimony</i> also identifies the standard for
                            measuring a candidate’s positions. “The Christian... [ought] to vote for civil rulers who
                            &hellip; are
                            publicly committed to scriptural principles of
                            civil government.” (<i>RPT</i> 23.15; cf., 23.19) The
                            phrase “scriptural principles of civil government”
                            captures all that King Jesus assigns to states as
                            their duty before him. Paul writes, “Rulers are &hellip;
                            God’s servant[s] for your good&hellip; [and] avenger[s]
                            who carries out God’s wrath on the wrongdoer”
                            (Rom. 13:3–4). It is God’s definition of what is
                            good and just which ought to be the standard by
                            which Christians evaluate a candidate’s platform.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Scriptures teach to love our neighbor,
                            to care for the weak, to provide for the poor, to
                            preserve a neighbor’s property, to promote the
                            integrity of the family and the honesty of business dealings, to pursue only justice in war,
                            and
                            so forth. These are all matters of concern to King
                            Jesus as governor of the nations. The <i>Testimony</i>
                            calls us to assess the policies of candidates in relation to Jesus’ priorities for human
                            society.

                        <p>
                            Modern campaign rhetoric tends to focus on the benefit a candidate’s victory would
                            bring to the voter’s own station in life, to one’s
                            job prospects, to a certain business market, or
                            to other civic causes that will resonate with the
                            voter’s own concerns. But the Christian should
                            resist those temptations and vote to advance “scriptural

                            Again, there are some who interpret this line of the
                            <i>Testimony</i> more restrictively. Some Reformed Presbyterians withhold their vote from
                            any
                            candidate who does
                            not acknowledge that most fundamental principle of scriptural civil
                            government: namely, that Jesus is the
                            King and the source of all true justice.
                            That conviction is, indeed, the ideal
                            toward which all Reformed Presbyterians are urged to labor and to pray.
                            Whether one exercises his or her
                            vote in a spirit of graduated progress
                            toward that ideal, or withholds one’s
                            vote in persevering witness while
                            waiting for that ideal, the language of the <i>Testimony</i>
                            unifies our faith in that ultimate expectation.

                        <p>
                            Civil government, as an institution under Jesus’
                            crown, is accountable to operate according to scriptural
                            principles. Therefore we who acknowledge Jesus as already king over the state will vote for
                            candidates whose
                            positions serve “scriptural principles of civil government.”

                            Political passions are running high in American society.
                            And we are not immune to those passions as Reformed
                            Presbyterians. But we have a guiding conviction for our
                            political engagement that transcends political party affiliation. Our commitment must be to
                            honor King Jesus
                            in our engagement with this year’s election. This is not
                            a cause for angst, since it is not our vote that “makes”
                            Jesus king. Indeed, our doctrinal convictions should
                            grant us greater peace as those who know Jesus is
                            already the king over our nation, regardless of how any
                            particular election turns out.

                            In that confidence, the <i>Testimony</i> offers us simple
                            but important guidance for evaluating our votes this
                            year in light of Jesus’ priorities for civil government.
                            Some will draw more restrictive applications from the
                            <i>Testimony</i> regarding those for whom they feel conscientiously free to support with
                            their
                            ballot. Others will
                            apply the <i>Testimony’s</i> guidance for evaluating lessthan-ideal candidates. The
                            <i>Testimony</i> gives
                            room for
                            these differences on how we exercise our votes, but it
                            also unites us in a common conviction for Christ’s rule.
